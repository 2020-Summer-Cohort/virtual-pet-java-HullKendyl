# Virtual Pet

###### **VirtualPetApplication**

Take care of your newly adopted VirtualPet by selecting the options prompted. 

Each decision you make will affect your VirtualPet's needs points. In addition to the effects of your decision, 
your VirtualPet's Hunger & Thirst need points will decrease by two points each turn.

If you reach a status of 50 need points in any category, you win!

If you reach a status of 0 need points in any category, you lose. 

Good luck! We hope you have fun taking care of your new VirtualPet!
